# Human-pose-estimation

A quick tutorial on multi-pose estimation with OpenCV, Tensorflow and MoveNet lightning.

> **Also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ibrahimserouis99/human-pose-estimation-with-movenet)

# Motivation 

I found multipose estimation Notebooks and codes not so explicit or even understandable for pure beginners. As a result, the idea of writing my own tutorial naturally came to me. After some research and a bit of styling, code cleaning, presentation...I've finally made it public. 

# Model info 

- Model type : MoveNet 
- Pose estimation method : multipose, bottom-up
- Keypoints count : 17

# Results (example)

# Required packages

- Deep Learning and calculations : Tensorflow 2.x, NumPy, Tensorflow Docs
- Computer graphics/vision : OpenCV 
- Display : IPython, Matplotlib 
- Image/video writer : image io

# Acknowledgements
